***___ Arrhythmia Detection from ECG ___***
	
	The project detects the arrhythmia from the ECG provided. This project is developed using the matlab licensed software. The arrhythmia is detected from the R-peak parameters in the ECG signal. 

Steps:-
Directly Run HeartRateDetection.m

Files:-
-> findextremas.m	- Finds the extremas in the signal.
-> HeartRateDetection.m	- Detects the arrhythmia.
-> data			- Contains the dataset used.
